Origin-driven caching is safer for APIs because it allows for us to dynamically and programatically select which type of caching to utilize. If something is meant to have no caching within the same application as other things that can benifit from caching, one can utilize origin driven caching to write once (the configuration) and have the application read many times from the configuration about handling the data. I would still disable caching entirely if dealing with sensitive data that already provides a digital handshake because we never want to see that info being available via cache in the first place, this is data integrity.
