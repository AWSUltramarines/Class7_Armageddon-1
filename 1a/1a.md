Screenshot of: RDS SG inbound rule using source = sg-ec2-lab EC2 role attached /list output showing at least 3 notes

Inspect a specific security group (inbound & outbound rules)

aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --group-ids sg-0f4afde3b9c95cd61 \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --output json

 

 

 

  

 

 

 




Short answers: A) Why is DB inbound source restricted to the EC2 security group? 
-It ensures that the database is not exposed to the public internet.
B) What port does MySQL use? 
-It uses port 3306
C) Why is Secrets Manager better than storing creds in code/user-data?
-Secrets Manager provides secure access control through IAM.  Also, SM encrypts the secrets.

Then Answer: 
1. Why each rule exists? 
-Allows EC2 instance to connect to the RDS database (MySQL) through port 3306.  
2. What would break if removed? 
-This is due to dependencies.  Without inbound port 3306 from the EC2 sg the application/app server cannot connect to the database and read it.  Also, a removal can prevent the 
EC2 from reaching the Secrets.  
3. Why broader access is forbidden? 
-Due to rule of least privilege.  This allows only network traffic from the specified resources to be in place.
4. Why this role exists? 
This allows the EC2 to read a secret from the Secrets Manager
5. Why it can read this secret? 
-The IAM policy is attached to the role.
6. Why it cannot read others?
-IAM policies are for specific resources and not all or other resources.
